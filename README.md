# SVM
Support Vector Machine for classification
<br>
## What is SVM?

1. SVM is the Support Vector Machine. 
2. SVM is a supervised Machine learning model.
3. It can be used for both classification or regression challenges.


The idea of SVM is simple: <br>
The algorithm *creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.*

SVM is more effective in high dimensional spaces. SVM is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. 

They can be applied to both linear and non linear problems.

In simple terms, SVM is a supervised learning method that looks at data and sorts it into one of two categories. An SVM outputs a map of the sorted data with the margins between the two as far apart as possible.
