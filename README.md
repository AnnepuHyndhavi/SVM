# SVM
Support Vector Machine for classification
<br>
## What is SVM?

1. SVM is the Support Vector Machine. 
2. SVM is a supervised Machine learning model.
3. It can be used for both classification or regression challenges.


The idea of SVM is simple: <br>
The algorithm *creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.*

SVM is more effective in high dimensional spaces. SVM is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
